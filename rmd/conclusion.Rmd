# Issues and potential improvements.
The problem may be that the distribution is rather skewed.
Therefore, it is rather difficult to choose for it a competent distribution.
Maybe in the future it'd be better to try one more distribution - gamma or such extensions of exponential, like: 
exponentiated exponential (has properties, similar to Gamma distribution, but survival function like a Weibull).

Also, maybe it'd be worth to pay more attention to features and apply transformation or even extraction to them.
Moreover, the priors can be tested even more accurately, variant like half-cauchy can be tried.

# Conclusion what was learned from the data analysis.


# Self-reflection of what the group learned while making the project

The group learnt a lot about the applications of MCMC methods to Survival analysis.
Previously, some of us did not even know about the concept of Survival analysis, about such terms, like
survival, hazard function, or with what distributions survival time can be simulated. Also, previously, there wasn't chance to dive deep into the  Weibull regression models, now degree of understanding of this model increased. Last but not least, some functions in R were discovered (connected with bayesian statistics), about which have never heard before.
