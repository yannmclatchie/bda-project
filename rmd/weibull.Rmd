# Weibull Generalised Linear Model

Let $y \sim \text{Weibull}(\alpha, \sigma)$, so that
$$
\text{Weibull}(y|\alpha,\sigma) =
\frac{\alpha}{\sigma} \, \left( \frac{y}{\sigma} \right)^{\alpha - 1}
\, \exp \! \left( \! - \left( \frac{y}{\sigma} \right)^{\alpha}
\right),
$$
for $y \in [0,\infty), \alpha \in \mathbb{R}^+,$ and $\sigma \in \mathbb{R}^+$. 

## Motivating the distribution

The Weibull distribution is often used as a more flexible and complex alternative to the semi-parametric proportional hazard Cox model for modelling time to failure events, since the hazard rate is not taken to be constant with time.

## The Weibull distribution as a member of the exponential family

Now take $\alpha$ fixed and finite, then it can be shown that this distribution belongs to the exponential family since we can write it's probability density function
$$
\text{Weibull}(y|\sigma) ={\alpha y^{\alpha -1}}\exp(-y^{\alpha}\sigma^{-\alpha}-\alpha\log\sigma),
$$
with
\begin{align*}
b(y)&={\alpha y^{\alpha -1}} \\
\eta&=\sigma^{-\alpha}\\
T(y)&=-y^{\alpha} \\
a(\eta)&=\alpha\log\sigma.
\end{align*}

## Defining the link function

Looking at our sufficient statistic $\eta=\sigma^{-\alpha}$, it can be shown that
$$
\sigma=\exp{({\frac{\log\eta}{-\alpha}})}
$$
where we construct $\eta = \exp(\boldsymbol X\beta)$ so that $\eta$ is strictly positive. Thus we choose a log link function for our GLM such that
$$
\sigma = \exp(-\frac{\boldsymbol X\beta}{\alpha}).
$$
